# ikon_list

Flutter Challenge

## Getting Started

Given a list of contact names (List<String>), render aan address book list where the names are grouped by their first character.

## Requirements

- Implementation should be done in it's own widget, expected to be called GroupView, which will be receiving the items.
- It should be a single, scrolling widget.
- It should only display valid elements.
- Each element should be tappable, and the next screen should just display the name in detail.
- The widget should be generic, and be able to work with any data type.
- Preferably the widget should use slivers and a customscrollview.
- It should be possible to add a header and footer widget to the list.
- A search field should be available to search and filter the list by name.
- Describe in the README.md file why a "scroll to index" behaviour is not as straightforward.
- Describe in the README.md file the approach taken to solve the challenge and the architecture of the app.
